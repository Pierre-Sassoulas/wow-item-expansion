wow-item-expansion
------------------

Displays the item's extension of origin in item's tooltip; so you can see easily from which expansion an object
originate from.

:warning: Deprecated in favor of https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemversion. And inferior.
Knowing if something was added during a beta for the next extension requires a lot of knowledge and
care and time to update the information, we're only using the WOW API for this addon which is fast
to code and require no maintenance but also often innacurate.
